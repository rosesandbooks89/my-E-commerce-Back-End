## Struggles and Sources
Using week 13 activities as a guide, I was able to complete this project. Thankfully most of the code was provided in the sample code. 
During this project, I struggled with the following issues:
I had a hard time getting insomnia to work. I was able to get it to work after my tutor did a walk through with me and have a better understanding of how to use it.

I used the following sources for help:
* [Sequelize Documentation](https://sequelize.org/master/)
* [Express.js Documentation](https://expressjs.com/)
* [MySQL Documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/)
* [dotenv Documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv)
* [Insomnia Documentation](https://support.insomnia.rest/)
* [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
